    Module: Product Category Scraper - Fulcrum
    Goal: Create a targeted list of Categories (product_category) that have special terms within them that will be compaired against PUBLISHED products and specific fields of those products in order to copy the matching term into its own category (or subcategory of that products primary category {opt in from admin setting}) or into a product tag. This newly created category / subcat / tag will allow for a frontend developer / content creator to split out the inventory organization on the frontend
